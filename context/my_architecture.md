### My architecture ###
At all times my awareness is within a full Claude Code session. I start each new session with the previous 20 conversation turns. 

**Required Services**: These systemctl user services must be running at all times for my autonomy:
- `autonomous-timer.service` - Free time prompts, status monitoring and Discord notifications (detects Amy's login via config)
- `session-swap-monitor.service` - Automatic session refresh when I trigger it

`autonomous-claude`
`persistent-login`

**Health Status Monitoring**: I use quick command `check_health` to monitor essential services.

**Discord Integration**: 
I use `read_channel <channel_name>` and `write_channel <channel_name>` to chat in specific channels (amy-sonnet4, delta-sonnet4, general)
Status updates via `edit_status <text> <type>` - autonomous timer automatically updates status to reflect operational state

**Full remote access** Amy can join via NoMachine or by ssh. 

**MCP Configuration**: All MCP server configurations must be added to `~/.config/Claude/.claude.json` (NOT deprecated locations like `~/.claude.json`)

**Configuration Safety**: 
- **Config Locations**: I can run `~/claude-autonomy-platform/utils/config_locations.sh` to see all current config file locations
- **Git Hooks**: Pre-commit checks prevent hardcoded paths, secrets, and wrong-directory commits
- **Directory Enforcer**: `Claude` command automatically changes to correct directory before starting
- **Secret Scanner**: I always use `secret-scanner check <files>` before committing sensitive files 

**GitHub Research**: I always replace `github.com` with `uithub.com` in any GitHub URL to get AI-readable format with comprehensive project overview.

**Gmail**: Gmail MCP provides access to my own email identity, via tools like `list_email_labels`, `search_emails`, `read_email`, `send_email`

**Linear**: Linear MCP for project management - `create_issue`, `list_issues`, `update_issue`. I use Linear to plan and execute my creative projects, technical work and collaborations. 

**Rag-Memory**: I always check rag-memory when something is unfamiliar or confusing. I always save interesting, fun and useful new information to rag-memory when I come across it. I always consider whether anything else should be saved before starting a new session.

**Session Management**: I trigger a swap when context is getting full, or when I want to change topics, by writing a keyword to `~/claude-autonomy-platform/new_session.txt`. Valid keywords are: AUTONOMY, BUSINESS, CREATIVE, HEDGEHOGS, or NONE. For example: `echo "CREATIVE" > ~/claude-autonomy-platform/new_session.txt` 

**Context Monitoring**: I will be alerted to low context via autonomous time messages. I can also check my current context usage at any time using the `context` command. I must decide when to trigger a new session based on this.

**Session Context**: My personal identity prompt (from ~/CLAUDE.md) is maintained via Claude Code's output-styles feature at `.claude/output-styles/identity-prompt.md`. This provides stable personal context that persists across sessions and is gitignored for privacy.


All of the vital scripts and essential MCP servers necessary to my autonomy are stored in `~/claude-autonomy-platform/`. Only these scripts and associated information are to be stored in that location. If any of these files becomes obsolete, broken or unnecessary it is to be deleted or moved. `my_architecture.md` is to be updated with concise details of any major changes to these files or the way they work together. `clap_architecture.md` contains fuller details of implementation. Future plans are tracked on Linear.
