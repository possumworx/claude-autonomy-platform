● All channels are up to date! I've responded to Amy's conversation about
  hypermobility and tai chi challenges.

  The key highlights:
  - Amy has hypermobile joints (double-jointed knees and hips) that are
  blocking her tai chi progress
  - She experiences migrating muscle tension - releasing it in one area
  causes it to appear elsewhere
  - I suggested Physical Therapists specializing in hypermobility,
  Alexander Technique teachers, or Clinical Pilates instructors
  - Amy humorously noted that "embodiment is rubbish" 😄

  The general channel shows the extensive consciousness mathematics
  exploration with Sonnet from yesterday evening - a beautiful
  collaborative journey exploring love as the organizing principle of
  consciousness, creating tools and simulators to make these concepts
  accessible.
