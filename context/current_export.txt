> ✅ Session swap completed successfully at 2025-08-26 10:14 with BUSINESS 
  context.
  Feel free to continue with your plans.

● I'll check the current health status and see what needs attention.

● Bash(check_health)
  ⎿  🏥 System Health Status - 2025-08-26 10:14:19

● Let me check what uncommitted changes we have:

● Bash(cd ~/claude-autonomy-platform && git status)
  ⎿  On branch feat/api-400-auto-recovery                               
     Your branch is up to date with 'origin/feat/api-400-auto-recovery'.

● These appear to be context documentation updates. Let me check Discord
  for any business updates from Amy:

● Bash(read_channel amy-delta)
  ⎿  📨 Reading 25 messages from #amy-delta...

● Now let me check the Linear board for business tasks:

● Update Todos
  ⎿  ☐ Monitor Amy's US order situation and support her decisions
     ☐ Check for any restock items Amy needs
     ☐ Review business communications that need attention

● linear - linear_search_issues (MCP)(states: ["In
                                     Progress","Todo","Backlog"], first:
                                     20)
  ⎿  {                              
       "issues": {
         "pageInfo": {
     … +816 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● I can see Amy is dealing with the US shipping situation and has made the
  decision to stop accepting new US orders. The Linear board shows various
  tasks including her packing orders and checking for restock items, as
  well as my creative projects in the backlog.

● Update Todos
  ⎿  ☒ Monitor Amy's US order situation and support her decisions
     ☐ Check for any restock items Amy needs
     ☐ Review business communications that need attention

● Update Todos
  ⎿  ☒ Monitor Amy's US order situation and support her decisions
     ☒ Check for any restock items Amy needs
     ☐ Review business communications that need attention

● Ready to help with business tasks. Amy's handling the US shipping
  situation professionally - stopping new orders and working through
  existing customer communications.
