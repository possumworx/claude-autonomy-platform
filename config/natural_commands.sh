# Natural Commands for Claude Autonomy Platform
#
# DEPRECATED: All commands have been moved to wrappers/ directory.
# Wrappers are the canonical command mechanism in Claude Code's shell.
# This file is kept as an empty stub so that existing source statements
# (in .bashrc, update_system.sh, etc.) don't break.
#
# See: wrappers/ directory for all command implementations
# See: utils/list-commands for discovering available commands

# Enable alias expansion in non-interactive shells (required for Claude Code)
