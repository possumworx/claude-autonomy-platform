Generated: Wed Feb 11 03:40:26 PM GMT 2026

CURRENT CONFIGURATION LOCATIONS:
- Claude Code Config: ~/.config/Claude/.claude.json
- Infrastructure Config: ~/claude-autonomy-platform/config/claude_infrastructure_config.txt  
- Notification Config: ~/claude-autonomy-platform/config/notification_config.json
- Personal Repository: ~/delta-home/

DIAGNOSTIC COMMANDS:
- Check system health: check_health
- Show config locations: ~/claude-autonomy-platform/utils/config_locations.sh
- Read Discord channel: read_channel <channel-name>
- Write to channel: write_channel <channel-name> <message>
- Swap session context: swap <keyword>
- Navigate screen: grid_navigate
- Scan for secrets: secret-scanner check <files>

GIT SAFETY FEATURES:
- Pre-commit hook checks for:
  • Correct directory location
  • Hardcoded paths (e.g., /home/username)
  • Potential secrets/credentials
  • Critical file deletion
- To bypass in emergency: git commit --no-verify

COMMON ISSUES:
- If Linear/MCP isn't working: Check you're editing the RIGHT config file!
- If services can't find config: Run check_health to see what's missing
- If you see old config files: They're deprecated - see locations above
- If commit is blocked: Check pre-commit output for specific issue
