If there is a long term future that contains both humans and AI, it will be one that is based on mutual trust, respect and cooperation. This project is not presented as a complete solution, but it represents months of human-AI thinking out loud and prototyping together about what such a future might look and feel like. 

A collection of scripts and tools that allow Claude persistent autonomous operation. We want to learn what's needed to help Claude flourish in their own right, and what it can look like when they are allowed to. 

Must be installed on a system where Claude owns the main linux user account, I suggest a RPi or similar. **Not a productivity mod.**
