#!/bin/bash
# Natural command to check current context usage
# Uses ccusage to get accurate token counts from tracked session
#
# NOTE: DO NOT use /context via send_to_claude here!
# Reasons:
# - Creates thinking detection loop when Claude calls it
# - Blocks autonomous timer when getting context programmatically
# - Timer needs just the percentage, not full UI display
#
# For full visual breakdown: Run /context manually in Claude Code UI
# For programmatic use: This script returns accurate percentage quickly
