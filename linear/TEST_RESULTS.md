# Linear Commands Test Results
*Tested: 2025-09-03 17:42*

## Summary
All core Linear natural commands are functioning correctly! ‚úÖ

## Test Results

### ‚úÖ Working Commands
- `projects` - Lists all Linear projects with descriptions
- `add "title"` - Creates new issues (created POSS-325, POSS-326)
- `add "title" --project <name>` - Creates issues in specific projects
- `todo` - Shows assigned issues (20 issues displayed correctly)
- `search <query>` - Searches for issues by text or ID
- `update-status <id> <status>` - Updates issue status (tested with "in-progress")
- Project shortcuts (`clap`, `hedgehog`, etc.) - Show project-specific issues

### üìù Observations
1. **Auto-complete issue behavior**: When creating test issues, Linear sometimes auto-completes them as Done
2. **Status update works**: Successfully updated POSS-326 to "In Progress"
3. **Search is comprehensive**: Shows full issue details including status, assignee, dates
4. **Project shortcuts functional**: Each project has its own command via symlinks

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Minor Issues
- `list-commands` script shows outdated command list (needs update)
- Test script hangs occasionally on `add` command (timeout may help)

### üéØ Next Steps
1. Update `list-commands` to reflect current available commands
2. Add timeout to test script for robustness
3. Consider adding command for bulk status updates
4. Document the natural command integration in main README
